Long before I have realized, I took up reading. I used to deeply hate it. I gave more thought to writting as I progress, but was never sure what to write about.

## Why ?

Getting off the mount stupid, be open to critics.

## The agony of living in the fast lane

Giving in to your hype is an amazing feeling. It gives you (sometimes) an insane ammount of energy. I love andrenaline rush, but what I definitely don't want is anxiety attacks afterwards. It is even worse as sometime the attack came before you have reached your goal. I feel like writing should stretch things out, going slower means keeping fun in the house.

## What will it be ?

Occasionally posts will be on CS, programming, maybe maths, sharing interesting articles, also maybe music. What it will not be is a life style blog, since I'm a terrible advisor, even worse: my life is a mess. But on this first blog, this will ever be the only exception.
